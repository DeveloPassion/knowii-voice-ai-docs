### Model Options

Different models offer different trade-offs:

- **Specialized models**: Optimized for specific use cases or languages

### Model Memory Management

Models can be configured to:

- **Load automatically** on app start
- **Auto-unload** after a period of inactivity (configurable)

## Tips for Best Results

### Recording Tips

- **Speak clearly** and at a normal pace
- **Reduce background noise** when possible
- **Use a good quality microphone** for best results
- **Stay consistent** in distance from the microphone

### Punctuation

The AI model automatically adds basic punctuation. For better results:

- **Pause naturally** between sentences
- **Speak punctuation** explicitly if needed (e.g., "comma", "period")

### Language
