# Basic Usage

Learn the fundamentals of using Knowii Voice AI for voice-to-text transcription.

## Recording Your Voice

The simplest way to use Knowii Voice AI:

1. **Press and hold** `Ctrl+Space` (default shortcut)
2. **Speak** clearly into your microphone
3. **Release** the shortcut when done speaking
4. The text is **automatically transcribed and pasted** at your cursor position

That's it! Works in any application - emails, documents, chat, browsers, IDEs, and more.

## Main Window & System Tray

When you launch Knowii Voice AI, the main window appears by default (showing settings and features). The app also places an icon in your system tray (near the clock).

**Important**: You can close the main window at any time - the app continues running in the background and remains fully functional.

The main window's icon changes based on the application state:

- **Idle**: Normal icon
- **Recording**: Recording icon
- **Transcribing**: Processing icon

### System Tray Icon

The system tray icon provides quick access to the app:

- **Right-click** the icon for quick access to:
    - The main window (Settings)
    - Check for updates
    - Cancel current operation
    - Quit application

The system tray icon also changes based on the application state.

## Audio Settings

### Microphone Selection

By default, Knowii Voice AI uses your system's default microphone. To change it:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to the **General** tab
3. Select your preferred **recording device** from the dropdown

### Audio Feedback

Knowii Voice AI plays sounds when you start and stop recording:

- **Customize** start and stop sounds
- **Choose** from built-in themes
- **Use your own** WAV or MP3 files (see [Application Data](./application-data) for details on where to place custom sound files)
- **Adjust** volume (0.0 - 1.0)

Configure in **Settings > General**.

## AI Models

### Managing Models

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to the **Transcription** tab
3. **Download** new models
4. **Switch** between models
5. **Deactivate** a model to free memory

**Tip**: You can also quickly switch to another downloaded model using the quick switcher in the bottom left

### Model Options

Different models offer different trade-offs:

- **Small models**: Faster, use less memory, slightly less accurate
- **Large models**: Slower, use more memory, more accurate (but require more a powerful computer)
- **Specialized models**: Optimized for specific use cases or languages

### Model Memory Management

Models can be configured to:

- **Load automatically** on app start
- **Auto-unload** after a period of inactivity
- **Never unload** for instant transcription (uses more memory)

Configure in **Settings > Advanced > Performance**.

## Tips for Best Results

### Recording Tips

- **Speak clearly** and at a normal pace
- **Reduce background noise** when possible
- **Use a good quality microphone** for best results
- **Stay consistent** in distance from the microphone

### Punctuation

The AI model automatically adds basic punctuation. For better results:

- **Pause naturally** between sentences
- **Speak punctuation** explicitly if needed (e.g., "comma", "period")

### Language

Knowii Voice AI supports multiple languages. Configure your language in **Settings > Transcription > Language**.
