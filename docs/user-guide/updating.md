# Updating Knowii Voice AI

Knowii Voice AI includes a built-in update system that makes keeping your installation current easy and secure.
This guide explains how to update Knowii Voice AI to the latest version.

## Check for Updates

1. The app will automatically check for updates on startup. You will see "Checking" in the status bar and in the About screen
2. You can also force checking for updates by clicking on "Check for updates" in the status bar, in the About screen or using the system tray menu

## Download and Install Updates

### Through the app

1. If a new version is available, you will see "Update available" in the status bar and "Install Update" in the About screen
2. Click on "Update available" in the status bar or on "Install Update" in the About screen to download the new version and launch the installer
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. **Launch** the new version from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut

### Manually

If you prefer to update manually or face an issue with the built-in update feature:

1. **Download** the latest version for your platform:
    - From your [Gumroad Library](https://gumroad.com/library) (if purchased there)
    - From the [Knowii Community](https://www.knowii.net) website (if purchased there)
2. **Run the installer**:
    - Run the installer (it will automatically detect and update your existing installation)
    - Follow the installation wizard
3. **Launch** the updated application from your Start Menu or desktop shortcut

## Update Security

All updates downloaded through the built-in updater are:

- **Cryptographically signed**: Each update is verified using digital signatures to ensure it hasn't been tampered with
- **Authenticated**: Only official updates from DeveloPassion can be installed
- **Secure**: Downloaded over HTTPS from trusted servers

If signature verification fails, the update will be rejected and you'll be notified. This protects you from malicious updates.

## What Happens to My Data?

When you update Knowii Voice AI:

- **Settings are preserved**: All your preferences, shortcuts, and configurations remain intact
- **History is kept**: Your transcription history and starred items are not affected
- **Models stay downloaded**: Your AI models don't need to be re-downloaded
- **Audio files remain**: All saved audio recordings are preserved

Your data is stored separately from the application, so updates never delete or modify your personal data.

## Update Frequency

Knowii Voice AI receives regular updates with:

- **New features**: Enhanced functionality and capabilities
- **Improvements**: Better performance and user experience
- **Bug fixes**: Resolution of reported issues
- **Security patches**: Important security updates when needed

Check the [Release Notes](../release-notes) to see what's new in each version.

## Troubleshooting Updates

### Update Check Fails

If checking for updates doesn't work:

1. **Check your internet connection**: Update checks require internet access
2. **Check firewall settings**: Ensure Knowii Voice AI can access the internet
3. **Try again later**: The update server may be temporarily unavailable
4. **Manual update**: Use the manual update method instead

### Update Download Fails

If downloading an update fails:

1. **Check your internet connection**: Ensure you have a stable connection
2. **Check disk space**: Make sure you have enough free space for the update
3. **Try again**: Click "Download Update" again (downloads can be resumed)
4. **Manual update**: Download and install manually instead

### Update Installation Fails

If installing an update fails:

1. **Close the application**: Make sure Knowii Voice AI is fully closed
2. **Check permissions**: Ensure you have permission to update the application
3. **Try manual update**: Download and run the installer manually
4. **Contact support**: If problems persist, see the [Support](../support) page

### Signature Verification Fails

If update signature verification fails:

1. **DO NOT install the update**: This could indicate a security issue
2. **Try downloading again**: The download may have been corrupted
3. **Check for announcements**: Visit the release notes page for any security notices
4. **Contact support**: Report the issue at support@knowii.net

## Downgrading

While not officially supported, if you need to use an older version:

1. **Backup your data** (found in `%APPDATA%/knowii-voice-ai/` on Windows)
2. **Uninstall** the current version
3. **Install** the older version manually
4. **Restore your data** if needed
